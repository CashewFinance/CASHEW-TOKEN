# CASHEW-TOKEN

Cashew token(CASH) is the main token in the CASHEW ecosystem. 

This token was created to have an initial total supply of 200,000 tokens and implements a burn rate of 0.1% per token transfer transaction. This reduces the total supply by 0.1% of transfer value everytime a transfer transaction is sent.

This ensures an already minute supply is always reduced while demand is on the rise.


CASHEW will implement several protocols in the the future, all geared at raising demand and reducing the amount of Cashew tokens(CASH) in circulation.
